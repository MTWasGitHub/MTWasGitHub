# Hello, I'm MTWas
I know various programming languages, like Javascript, Java and Python.  
I also have a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf2vG8iZDf77fJN7MCdt2KQ), but I'm not active anymore :(  
I'm looking forward to learn Typescript, when I have time for it.  
# Contact
Currently, there is not a really way to reach me. Try writing a comment on my Youtube channel.
